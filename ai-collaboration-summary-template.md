# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** Ivana San Pedro

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: Learning the meaning of dquote>

**My prompt:**

> What does dquote> mean

**What happened:**

dquote> was appearing on the terminal, and I was unsure of what it wanted me to do. It meant there was a double quote that needed to be closed, I was missing a double quote. It might have been a typo when copying and pasting from the INSTRUCTIONS.md.

### Interaction 2: Changing the cowsay creature

**My prompt:**

> How do I change the creature

**What happened:**

Agent said to run cowsay with a specific creature, I need to use -f name. Before, I didn't know where to put the creature's name in the statement, so Agent really helped me on this one.

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

This file breaks down package.json. It provides the definitions for each field, an example, and its significance.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

[How was using Agent for npm setup different from typing commands yourself? What are the advantages? Any downsides?]
Using Agent for npm setup was efficient. I think if I were to type commands myself, I would encounter numerous errors. Agent is useful in this case because it is familiar with npm and serves as a tool in improving my understanding in cowsay. It also showed me what changes I made and gave me a more detailed commit message as an option. 

### What you learned (required)

[What was the most useful thing you learned in this assignment? This could be about npm, Agent mode, documentation, or anything else.]
The most useful thing I learned were the fields in the package.json and altering the scripts inside the .md. In addition, the way the terminal communicates with the package.json. 

### Optional questions

Answer any of these that interest you:

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages? How did they compare to your own?
Yes, I used Agent to write commit messages. There wasn't a huge difference, but Agent's messages were more specific than mine.
- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?
